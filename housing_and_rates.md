Auckland is in the midst of a housing crisis. The median property price is now ten times the median income. So too are rents rising, and our population of homeless and rough sleepers increasing. Reports of families sleeping in cars or garages are not uncommon, and have broken international news. Young families are unlikely to be able to realistically aspire to own a home in this market.

Things do not have to be this way. But, if we continue to dig our head in the sand, or ignore that the solution to this problem comes with a necessary decrease in pricing in our overheated market, we will never fix it. 

In the following, I outline the steps that I would take as your Mayor to mitigate and correct Auckland’s housing market. This relates tangentially to solving our homelessness problem, but I've found that issue deserving of its own policy - to be released shortly.
Removing artificial barriers to increasing supply
To accommodate growing demand, Auckland needs moderate, sustainable, and quality growth in its supply.

Auckland’s housing supply is currently restricted by strict zoning regulations, which currently prohibits building both up and out. The Proposed Unitary Plan aims to tackle this, by allowing for that necessary growth (note: nobody is required to give up their home nor replace it with a taller building, but those who do wish to build are now not prohibited from doing so). It enables the potential for real choice in our future market: from stand-alone, to terraced housing, and apartments.

All going well, the Proposed Unitary Plan will pass and set Auckland in good stead for the future in terms of land supply and growth (both up and out). However, Council's involvement does not end at the Unitary Plan - there will need be effective local governance monitoring supply, demand, and development quality.

# Streamline the consenting process

Currently, those seeking to build or develop for both business and residential purposes face an inordinate amount of red tape, bureaucracy, expense and delays. This disincentivises people from seeking to build or develop, a barrier requiring removal to see Auckland flourish. To achieve this, we need to:

* Streamline and simplify (greater clarity of fees, process and steps; less double handling; more accountability)

* Digitise (move the system online and into the 21st century)

# Reform rates

Currently, Auckland's rates are calculated by:

Capital Value (Land Value + Improvement Value) + Fixed Charges (i.e. Uniform Annual General Charge + Interim Transport Charge) + 'Other Rates'
In 2016/17, Capital Value makes up 79% of the total rates income for the Council. So, it's important to understand how it works. Its two components are Land Value ("the most likely selling price of the bare land at the date of valuation"), and Improvement Value ("Capital Value minus Land Value. The Improvement Value does not represent the replacement value of the building(s) and/or other improvements on the land."). However, numerous applications to the Council have highlighted that they seemingly do not have the ratio breakdown for Land Value : Improvement Value collected in Capital Value, illustrating that its 'mass appraisal valuation' methodology does not clearly calculate either, instead focusing on figuring out Capital Value, and retrofitting numbers to the LV and IV figures.

This is highly problematic when a simple search on the Council's 'rates and valuations property search' yields inexplicably inconsistent Land Values for neighbouring properties (taking into account differences in square-metreage).

Further lies the problem of how this rates system incentivises property as an investment, not as a utility. With Improvement value included in the calculation, it essentially means that people are taxed, in perpetuity, for improving their land, by building or adding more features to their property. In turn, under the Capital Value system, those using their land effectively and practically are charged proportionally more rates than those who choose to keep their land bare, or unimproved (for example, think of the paved, “unimproved” carparks sitting on multi-million dollar land in the central city).

Taxing improvement disincentivises development, and can incentivise land banking and speculation - in essence, holding the market and surrounding community to ransom. Ransom for land, which, had it been used effectively, could have in the meantime been used to curb our housing crisis by providing more housing, or adding to our economy by being utilised for business.

Economically, calculating rates on a simple Land Valuation makes substantially more sense than Capital Value. But it’s not just because it incentivises development and efficient use of land (and would make it financially unsensible to speculate), but because it would cool our housing market’s over-inflated prices, reduce rents, minimise sprawl - and rates would reflect that for the most part, the result of ascending house prices is due to public and community investment: new businesses and cafes in the area, public parks, transport infrastructure and the like are all things which increase the value of a plot of land for the landowner, but are the result of other people’s (often the taxpayer’s) investment.

I propose a rates calculation based on one thing alone:

# Land Value

Which would ease the burden on those using their land efficiently, by balancing it out and seeing those who are not doing so - those holding the community to ransom - are paying equitably to do so. This is not a silver bullet, but in combination with the rest of my policy, leadership and vision, would enable Auckland to not only recover from its housing crisis, but generate a stable market which would economically withstand global financial downturns, and bring back to life the kiwi dream of being able to own a home.

# Council Funding
Internationally, local governments control an average of 30% of all government’s spending; in New Zealand, recent reports show our local governments control around 11% of spending (leaving central government with 89%), less than half of the international average.

This control of funding is a problem when we need to provide infrastructure to accommodate population growth and new housing.

Whilst local governments are predominantly publicly perceived as responsible for the problems in their constituencies, in New Zealand, they have less resources to solve these problems than in other comparable nations. This places the broader power to fund local public projects in the hands of central government, which is less inclined to be familiar with local needs than an elected local government.

One such example of granting Auckland Council greater discretionary funding to respond to local needs is by redistributing taxation on local expenditure. As your Mayor, I would work with central government to see Auckland Council receive taxation more in-line with international averages, allowing greater autonomy to generate truly localised solutions.
