# Let's design our city for people.

There is a lot of money ($1.4billion in 2015 alone) spent on transport in Auckland. But we're not seeing that cost reflected in choice.

Choice is the freedom to choose how you, as the people of Auckland, navigate our city. Currently, many parts of our city are automobile-dependent, because the alternative options (public transport, cycling, or walking) are impracticable or inaccessible.

This lack of choice forces more people onto our roads at an exponential rate, as 800 new cars are registered for Auckland roads each week. More blind investment in roading projects at the expense of alternative transport results only in more cars to fill up those new, wider, shiny roads. This is why, in our 2013 Census, we saw that 74% of Auckland drove to work in their own private cars (70% driving by themselves).

To see our roads function properly, we need to invest in projects to get people - especially those people who don't actually want to be there - off of those roads.

As your Mayor, I will advocate for a bold shift in focus: I will see that Auckland's public transport system is a real, viable, and efficient option to get where you're going. I will see Auckland thrive by becoming walkable, and cycleable.

## Public Transport
Imagine an Auckland where you could travel quickly from A to B in comfort (with free wifi!), instead of bumper-to-bumper with every other individual sitting in their car.

Auckland Council has committed to our Rapid Transit Network (RTN), laying the groundwork of a spectacular public transport framework that will see Auckland truly connected, our roads less congested, and people moving easily and freely from work, home, and play. Unfortunately, the plan in its current form will not be completed for another 30 years.

In no small part was the RTN influenced by the brilliant work of Transport Blog and Generation Zero, who initially proposed their own 'Congestion Free Network'. I have no concerns about supporting great ideas - Auckland's future is so much more than whose name is rubber stamped onto a plan's genesis; it's even bigger than me, you, or even our kids.

We're on track for a bright future with the RTN, but I propose realigning priorities to move along crucial progress faster. As your Mayor, I will prioritise, bring forward, and champion:

Increasing frequency and continuity of public transport on our current networks. In a number of submissions, people have told me of wait times upwards of an hour for busses. This should sit at closer to 15 minutes.

Rail to Auckland Airport. In the current RTN plan, rail to Auckland Airport is not a certainty - and if it is given the green light, it won't be completed until 2046. I will see it on our 10 year horizon. Whether this is Light Rail or Heavy Rail will depend on research still to be conducted.

Growth of feeder services. Feeder services are the public transport systems that get you to arterial public transport. We've seen a reliance on park and rides in place of feeder services, and been rewarded with overflowing carparks. This problem is not dissimilar from our current approach of building more roads, subsequently encouraging more auto-dependence. I will see that we invest in feeder services for fluid public transport, instead of falling back on automobile reliance on the homestretch of each journey.

Rail on Auckland's second harbour crossing. We know that Auckland will need a second harbour crossing by 2030 to accommodate our population growth. In working with central government on this project, I will ensure that we do not fall into the same problems we've experienced with our current Harbour Bridge, promoting congestion by way of only really catering to cars, with only the recent addition of the Northern Express Busways. I support rail on our second Waitematā crossing, which recent polling has shown many other Aucklanders do too.

Trialling routes destined for rail with uncongested busways. Where we're looking to eventually lay Light Rail around Auckland, I propose we begin as soon as possible in designating uncongested busways, allowing patrons a taste of the efficiency to come, and in turn, proving that when people have real alternative options, they will use them.

Working with central government to ensure public transport infrastructure is given proper priority - over and above new roads. We're headed in the right direction with the Auckland Transport Alignment Project, and I will ensure that NZTA's spending on Auckland works towards our vision of Rapid Transit. There are a number of ways this could be achieved, including creating a Joint Committee with the Minister of Transport.

Public transport has the added bonus of paying for itself over time with patronage - the only way to achieve this with roading is with things nobody's all too fond of: tolling, congestion tax, or carbon tax.

## Cycling and walking

The Skypath's passage in Council was a momentous occasion for all Aucklanders. For the first time, we'll be able to walk or cycle across the Waitematā.

Cycling is the cheapest and most efficient way to get around a city. Where we've seen investment in safe cycling (Lightpath, Grafton Gully, Nelson Street and Quay Street), numbers of people cycling has gone up. Where we haven't, it's remained relatively constant. That said, in May 2016, cycling numbers across Auckland rose by 22%.

For a long time, there's been tension between cyclists and drivers. This has been driven by their being forced to share roads - it's incredibly dangerous for cyclists, and can be frustrating for drivers. Cycling needs to be taken seriously as the huge growth area it is in our city, and I will work to see that all new (inevitable) roading developments are accompanied by safe cycling areas, demarcated from the road, alongside. I will investigate areas requiring increased cycling safety and promotion, and work with the local communities to ensure that their goals are reached.

So too will walking increase in my vision for Auckland, where the city increases density in a logical manner, along arterial routes, in the CBD, and in our pockets of mixed residential and commercial activity. Further, I am committed to promoting walkability by ensuring it is treated as a genuine consideration in all planning (redevelopment, or future) projects.
